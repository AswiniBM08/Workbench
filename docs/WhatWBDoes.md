# What the Workbench does

## Configure GenevaERS to do things

The Workbench is how you tell GenevaERS what needs to be done.

Like most things in IT, it is a matter of:
1.  Define inputs
2.  Define processing
3.  Define outputs

A collection of the three points above is called a "view".  Running GenevaERS is a matter of preparing views in the Workbench and then running the views in the Performance Engine. 

The Performance Engine is the part of GenevaERS that actually produces the results.  When you downloaded the demo you downloaded a working copy of the Performance Enginel;

Once you have installed the Workbench, you need to learn all the possibilities for the a view which is all about the three points above.

One way to start is to look at the Workbench configuration for the GenevaERS demo.
