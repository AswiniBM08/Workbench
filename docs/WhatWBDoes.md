# What the Workbench does (introduction)

## Configure GenevaERS to do things

The Workbench is how you tell GenevaERS what needs to be done.

Like most things in IT, it is a matter of:
1.  Define inputs
2.  Define processing
3.  Define outputs

A collection of the three points above is called a "**view**".  A view shows what your requested processing for GenevaERS.

Running GenevaERS is a matter of preparing views in the Workbench and then running the views in the Performance Engine. 

The Performance Engine is the part of GenevaERS that actually produces the results.  When you downloaded the demo you downloaded a working copy of the Performance Engine.

Once you have installed the Workbench, you need to learn how to use it.  

One way to learn is to look at the views for the GenevaERS demo - see [Demo views](DemoViews.md).

After learning from the demo views, see **Full Workbench documentation** (link not available yet).
